                It's been exactly 140 days since we first spoke to each other that day in the canteen and also became
                friends. It's been an incredible journey getting to know you, you are kind, caring and lovely (who
                doesn't like to eat but you're trying, I must say lol) joke apart I really appreciate you and I pray God
                shall bless you and keep you! As you turn a new age you shall see many more years filled with joy,
                peace, happiness and they shall never cease in Jesus' name, I pray for excellence in everything you do.
                you shall fulfill the plan God has for your life in Jesus' name, Amen. Finally I pray that God shall
                strengthen our friendship, guide us and lead us as we celebrate more birthdays together, Amen.
