            <p>A general physical examination as well as directed assessment of the mass complements the history.
                Scleral icterus or jaundice suggests liver infiltration versus biliary obstruction from a bile duct or
                pancreatic tumor. Temperature higher than 38°C is consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process
                such as an intra‐abdominal abscess. Lower fevers may accompany some neoplasms. If the mass is tender, as
                with Crohn’s disease, this suggests that the mass is inflammatory.
                Lymphadenopathy raises concern for metastatic malignancy. Palpable supraclavicular (Virchow) or
                periumbilical (Sister Mary Joseph) nodes are found with gastric cancer. Rectal examination detects
                approximately half of all rectal neoplasms. Occult fecal blood is highly predictive of malignancy in a
                patient with a known abdominal mass
